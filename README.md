### Hi, I'm Zain 👋

I'm a computer scientist who enjoys working at the intersection of science and engineering.

- 🎓 Currently an [MS Computer Engineering](https://compeng.columbia.edu/) student at Columbia University.
- 🚀 I work as a Flight Software Engineer at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/).
- 🔭 I'm interested in ML/RL applications, embedded systems, and making cool things.

Maybe one day I'll get around to writing for my [blog](https://zain-merchant.com/blog.html).
